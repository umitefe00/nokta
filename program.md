## 0. IMMUTABLE INFRA

The following files are the backbone of the project. Contributors MUST NOT modify them. CI enforces this.

- `.github/workflows/`: CI pipeline. Modifying this breaks the ratchet. Only maintainer can edit.
- `scripts/section_score.py`: The scoring engine. Changing this would let PRs game the metric.
- `checklists/*.yml`: Scoring rubrics. These define truth. Only maintainer edits.
- `app.json`: Expo app identity. Changing this breaks builds for everyone.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript strictness settings. Loosening these defeats type safety.
- `babel.config.js`: Transpilation config. Touching this causes phantom build errors.
- `.eslintrc.js`: Lint rules. These are hard gates in CI; changing them bypasses quality control.
- `package.json`: Only maintainer may add/remove dependencies. Contributors propose via issue.
- `jest.config.js`: Test harness config. Essential for preventing CI circumvention.

**Why:** Karpathy's pattern works because infrastructure is fixed and only the editable surface changes. These files are the fixed infrastructure. Everything else is the editable surface.

## 1. IDENTITY

Nokta is a mobile app that captures idea sparks as small as a single word and matures them into structured product specs through guided questioning. It is not a chatbot, not a note-taking app, not a general-purpose AI assistant. It is an idea incubator.

The user starts with a dot — a single word, a fragment, a hunch. The system asks targeted questions. The dot becomes a line (a title), then a paragraph (a problem statement), then a page (a full spec with audience, solution, metrics, and effort estimate). The metaphor is cosmological: a singularity expands into a universe.

Target user: anyone with ideas but no structured process to mature them — founders, students, researchers, product managers.

Nokta is NOT:
- A general chatbot (conversations are structured interrogations, not open-ended)
- A note-taking app (the system actively challenges and shapes your input)
- A project management tool (it ends at spec, not at execution)
- A code generator (it produces specs, not software — the agent layer comes later)

---

## 2. SETUP PROTOCOL

**Target: Running app + passing tests in under 5 minutes.**

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.x, npm >= 9.x
- Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli` (or use npx)
- Git configured with GitHub access
- Physical device with Expo Go OR Android emulator / iOS simulator

### Init

```bash
npx create-expo-app nokta --template blank-typescript
cd nokta
```

### Install Dependencies

Only these dependencies are permitted for v0.1. Adding new ones requires a maintainer-approved issue.

```bash
# Core
npx expo install expo-router expo-constants expo-linking expo-status-bar

# Storage
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

# Dev/Test
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react-native @types/jest typescript
```

### Verify Setup

```bash
npm test                    # Jest tests pass
npx expo start              # App launches without crash
npx tsc --noEmit            # TypeScript compiles clean
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx # Lint passes
```

All four commands must pass before any PR is opened.

---

## 3. NON-GOALS

These are explicitly out of scope for v0.1. Building any of these will result in PR rejection.

- **Backend server** — No Express, no NestJS, no Supabase server. All data is local (AsyncStorage). Reason: reduces infrastructure complexity to zero; students focus on product logic.
- **Authentication / login** — No user accounts, no OAuth, no JWT. The app is single-user, local-first. Reason: auth adds 2+ weeks of work and is irrelevant to the core idea-maturation flow.
- **App Store / Play Store publish** — No EAS Build, no signing, no store listing. APK is for demo only. Reason: store submission is a distraction from product iteration.
- **Real-time collaboration** — No multiplayer, no shared ideas, no WebSocket. Reason: single-user MVP must work perfectly before multi-user.
- **Payment / monetization** — No in-app purchases, no subscriptions, no ads. Reason: premature monetization kills MVP focus.
- **Analytics / telemetry** — No Mixpanel, no Amplitude, no crash reporting. Reason: adds dependency weight and privacy concerns for zero v0.1 value.
- **Offline-first sync** — Data lives in AsyncStorage, period. No conflict resolution, no delta sync. Reason: sync is a hard distributed systems problem — defer to v0.2+.
- **Internationalization (i18n)** — English only for v0.1. Turkish can be added in v0.2. Reason: i18n adds string management overhead that slows iteration.

## 4. DATA CONTRACTS

These TypeScript interfaces are the single source of truth. All components, services, and tests reference these types. They live in `src/features/idea/types.ts`.

```typescript
// === MATURITY STAGES ===

export enum MaturityStage {
  DOT = "dot",
  LINE = "line",
  PARAGRAPH = "paragraph",
  PAGE = "page",
}

// === CORE ENTITIES ===

export interface Idea {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  spark: string;
  maturity: MaturityStage;
  messages: Message[];
  spec: IdeaSpec | null;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}

export interface Message {
  id: string;
  role: "user" | "assistant";
  content: string;
  timestamp: string;
  turnNumber: number;
}

export interface IdeaSpec {
  problem: string;
  audience: string;
  solution: string;
  successMetrics: string;
  effortEstimate: string;
  uniqueness: string;
}

// === MATURITY TRANSITION RULES ===

export interface MaturityRule {
  from: MaturityStage;
  to: MaturityStage;
  requiredFields: (keyof IdeaSpec)[];
  minTurns: number;
}

export const MATURITY_RULES: MaturityRule[] = [
  { from: MaturityStage.DOT, to: MaturityStage.LINE, requiredFields: [], minTurns: 1 },
  { from: MaturityStage.LINE, to: MaturityStage.PARAGRAPH, requiredFields: ["problem", "audience"], minTurns: 3 },
  { from: MaturityStage.PARAGRAPH, to: MaturityStage.PAGE, requiredFields: ["problem", "audience", "solution", "successMetrics", "effortEstimate", "uniqueness"], minTurns: 5 },
];

// === STORAGE SCHEMA ===
// AsyncStorage keys: @nokta/ideas → string[] (ID list), @nokta/idea/<uuid> → Idea JSON
// All reads/writes go through src/features/idea/services/storage.ts
// Direct AsyncStorage access from components is FORBIDDEN.
```

## 5. SCREEN & FEATURE SPEC

### User Journey (canonical)

```
Open app → See idea list (empty state on first launch)
  → Tap FAB (+) → Enter spark ("drone cargo delivery")
  → System creates DOT → Navigate to Idea Chat
  → LLM asks: "What problem does this idea solve?"
  → User answers → Maturity: DOT → LINE
  → LLM asks: "Who experiences this problem the most?"
  → User answers → LLM asks more → Maturity: LINE → PARAGRAPH
  → Continue until PARAGRAPH → PAGE
  → Navigate to Spec Card → See structured spec
  → Return to list → See updated maturity indicator
```

### Screen 1: Idea List (Home) — `app/index.tsx`

The home screen shows all ideas as cards in a vertical list.

Components: `IdeaCard` (title, spark preview, maturity badge, timestamp), `MaturityBadge` (● ━ ¶ 📄, color-coded gray→yellow→blue→green), `EmptyState` ("Start with a dot." + pulsing dot animation), `FAB` (bottom-right, opens bottom sheet with TextInput).

Behavior: List sorted by updatedAt desc. Tap card → navigate to chat. Long-press → delete confirmation. FAB → bottom sheet → type spark → send → create DOT idea → auto-navigate to chat.

Acceptance Criteria:
- GIVEN no ideas WHEN app opens THEN empty state shown with FAB visible
- GIVEN 5 ideas WHEN app opens THEN all 5 cards visible, sorted by updatedAt desc
- GIVEN user taps FAB and types "drone delivery" WHEN user presses send THEN new DOT idea created and chat opens
- GIVEN user long-presses idea WHEN delete confirmed THEN idea removed from list and storage

### Screen 2: Idea Chat (Refinement) — `app/idea/[id].tsx`

SMS-style chat where the system guides refinement.

Components: `ChatBubble` (user=right/blue, assistant=left/gray), `MessageInput` (TextInput + send, disabled while loading), `MaturityProgress` (top bar, dot→line→paragraph→page), `SpecPreviewButton` (appears at PARAGRAPH+).

Behavior: First load with empty messages → system sends first question. Each user message → system responds with next question. Maturity transitions automatically per MATURITY_RULES. Transition announced: "Your idea is now a line! 🎉". Messages persisted to AsyncStorage after each turn. Auto-scroll to bottom.

Acceptance Criteria:
- GIVEN new DOT idea WHEN chat opens THEN system's first message visible
- GIVEN 3 answered questions WHEN maturity rules met THEN maturity transitions automatically
- GIVEN maturity PARAGRAPH WHEN user views chat THEN SpecPreviewButton visible
- GIVEN user closes/reopens chat WHEN messages existed THEN all messages restored

### Screen 3: Idea Spec Card — `app/idea/spec/[id].tsx`

Read-only structured spec view.

Components: `SpecField` (labeled field: Problem, Audience, Solution, Success Metrics, Effort, Uniqueness), `MaturityBadge`, `SparkOrigin` ("Your starting point: [spark]"), `ShareButton` (copy to clipboard as markdown).

Behavior: All IdeaSpec fields displayed. Empty fields show "Not yet defined" muted. Spec updates live from chat. Share copies formatted markdown to clipboard.

Acceptance Criteria:
- GIVEN PAGE maturity WHEN spec opens THEN all 6 fields populated
- GIVEN LINE maturity WHEN spec opens THEN available fields show, rest show placeholder
- GIVEN user taps share WHEN spec exists THEN formatted text copied with success toast

---

## 6. UI CONFIG

Nokta uses a lightweight local config system. This is NOT a remote server — it is a local `config/screens.json` that controls screen layout. The app shell reads this to render components.

### Config Schema

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "screens": {
    "home": {
      "components": [
        { "type": "IdeaList", "props": { "sortBy": "updatedAt", "sortOrder": "desc", "showMaturityBadge": true, "maxPreviewLength": 50 } },
        { "type": "FAB", "props": { "position": "bottom-right", "icon": "plus" } },
        { "type": "EmptyState", "props": { "message": "Start with a dot.", "showAnimation": true } }
      ]
    },
    "chat": {
      "components": [
        { "type": "MaturityProgress", "props": { "position": "top" } },
        { "type": "ChatBubble", "props": { "userColor": "#007AFF", "assistantColor": "#E5E5EA" } },
        { "type": "MessageInput", "props": { "placeholder": "Refine your idea...", "disableWhileLoading": true } }
      ]
    },
    "specCard": {
      "components": [
        { "type": "SparkOrigin", "props": { "highlighted": true } },
        { "type": "SpecField", "props": { "fields": ["problem", "audience", "solution", "successMetrics", "effortEstimate", "uniqueness"], "emptyText": "Not yet defined" } },
        { "type": "ShareButton", "props": { "format": "markdown" } }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Component Mapping

```typescript
// src/config/component-map.ts
const COMPONENT_MAP: Record<string, React.ComponentType<any>> = {
  IdeaList: IdeaListComponent,
  FAB: FABComponent,
  EmptyState: EmptyStateComponent,
  MaturityProgress: MaturityProgressComponent,
  ChatBubble: ChatBubbleComponent,
  MessageInput: MessageInputComponent,
  SparkOrigin: SparkOriginComponent,
  SpecField: SpecFieldComponent,
  ShareButton: ShareButtonComponent,
};
```

### Feature Flags

```typescript
// src/config/features.ts
export const FEATURES = {
  MOCK_LLM: true,
  SHOW_MATURITY_ANIMATION: true,
  ENABLE_DELETE: true,
  ENABLE_SHARE: true,
  MAX_IDEAS: 50,
  LLM_TIMEOUT_MS: 10000,
} as const;
```

**Note:** Full remote config (fetching screens.json from server) is deferred to v0.2.

---

## 7. LLM CONTRACT

The LLM asks structured refinement questions. In CI/testing: MOCK mode. In production: real API.

### Mock Mode (Default)

When `FEATURES.MOCK_LLM` is `true`, returns deterministic responses. No API calls.

```typescript
// src/services/llm.ts
export async function getNextQuestion(idea: Idea, messages: Message[]): Promise<string> {
  if (FEATURES.MOCK_LLM) return getMockResponse(idea.maturity, messages.length);
  return callLiveAPI(idea, messages);
}
```

### Mock Response Map

```json
{
  "dot_turn_0": "Interesting spark! What real-world problem does this idea solve? Who faces this problem?",
  "dot_turn_2": "I see. Who suffers from this problem the most? Can you define your target audience?",
  "line_turn_4": "Audience is clear. Now let's make your solution concrete — how exactly will you solve this problem?",
  "line_turn_6": "Solution is taking shape. How will you measure success? What metrics prove your idea works?",
  "paragraph_turn_8": "Great metrics. What is the key differentiator that sets this idea apart from similar ones?",
  "paragraph_turn_10": "Your idea is now a complete spec! Can you estimate the effort? (S/M/L/XL)",
  "fallback": "Can you elaborate on that? More detail will help us refine your idea further."
}
```

## 8. OBJECTIVE FUNCTION

### Hard Gates (Binary — fail any = instant reject)

| Gate | Command | Pass Condition |
|------|---------|----------------|
| TypeScript | `npx tsc --noEmit` | Zero errors |
| ESLint | `npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx` | Zero errors |
| Bundle Size | `npx expo export --dump-sourcemap` | JS bundle < 2MB |
| Dep Lock | `diff package.json` | No unauthorized new deps |

### Scalar Metric: Golden Flow Pass Rate

```
metric = (passing_golden_flow_tests / total_golden_flow_tests) × 100
```

Golden flow tests (Jest + React Native Testing Library):
1. **Create Idea** — FAB → enter spark → DOT idea created
2. **Refinement** — Chat opens → system question → answer → maturity transitions
3. **Spec View** — Spec card → populated fields match conversation
4. **Persistence** — Create → close → reopen → data intact

### Merge Rule

**PR merges if: all hard gates pass AND golden_flow_pass_rate(PR) ≥ golden_flow_pass_rate(main).**

---

## 9. THE RATCHET LOOP

The ratchet is the core quality enforcement mechanism of Nokta. Every PR must improve or maintain the current score. The score never drops. This is not a suggestion — it is a hard constraint enforced by CI.
```
Push code → PR opened
    ↓
CI triggers
    ↓
Hard Gates: tsc → eslint → bundle → deps
    ├── ANY FAIL → ❌ REJECT (stop)
    └── ALL PASS ↓
Golden Flow Tests
    ├── pr_score = run tests on PR
    ├── main_score = run tests on main
    └── pr_score >= main_score?
        ├── YES → ✅ ELIGIBLE
        └── NO  → ❌ REJECT: "Score {pr}% < main {main}%"
    ↓
Auto-merge (squash)
    ↓
New baseline established
```

**Score never drops. This is the ratchet.**

### Why the Ratchet?

Traditional code review relies on human judgment, which is slow, inconsistent, and unavailable at 3am. The ratchet replaces subjective review with an objective metric. If your change improves the product, it merges. If it doesn't, it doesn't. No negotiation, no exceptions.

This pattern is inspired by Karpathy's autoresearch model: a single measurable scalar drives all contribution decisions. Contributors compete to improve the same number. The highest score wins.

### Merge Queue

One PR merges at a time. After a merge, all waiting PRs receive a fresh CI run against the new baseline.

Rules:
- The active PR is the lock holder. No PR jumps the queue.
- Waiting PRs must not modify the same sections as the lock holder — this causes merge conflicts that reset the queue.
- Manual overrides by maintainers are forbidden. Skipping the queue breaks the ratchet math for all waiting PRs.
- If two PRs target the same section, the first to merge sets the new baseline. The second must beat it.

### What Triggers a CI Run

| Event | CI Triggered? |
|---|---|
| PR opened | ✅ Yes |
| New commit pushed to PR branch | ✅ Yes |
| PR base branch updated (merge queue) | ✅ Yes |
| PR comment added | ❌ No |
| PR description edited | ❌ No |
| Draft PR converted to ready | ✅ Yes |

Every `git push` re-triggers CI. Fix → push → wait.

### Rerun + Rescore Protocol

If your PR is rejected, follow these steps:

1. Read the CI comment carefully. It lists which checklist items failed and the score delta.
2. Pull the latest main to check if someone else merged and raised the baseline: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`
3. Fix the failing items in `program.md` or your spec file.
4. Re-run the score locally before pushing: `python scripts/section_score.py --section <N>`
5. Push the fix: `git push origin <your-branch>`
6. CI re-runs automatically. The sticky comment in the PR refreshes in place — no new comment is posted.

Do not close and reopen the PR. Push to the same branch. The CI comment updates automatically.

### Score Delta Table

Every CI run posts a score table to the PR comment:

| Section | main score | PR score | Delta | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Section 03 | 72 | 85 | +13 | ✅ |
| Section 09 | 60 | 60 | 0 | ✅ |
| Section 12 | 45 | 40 | -5 | ❌ |

A PR passes only if **all modified sections** have delta ≥ 0. A single section dropping is enough to reject the entire PR.

### Baseline Reset Policy

The baseline (main branch score) is sacred. It can only move up, never down. If a bug in the scoring script causes an artificially high score to be merged, the maintainer may issue a baseline correction — but this requires a public issue and a maintainer-signed commit. Contributors are notified via PR comments on all open PRs.

### Anti-Patterns That Break the Ratchet

- **Deleting content to game the score** — removing sections or checklist items that you cannot improve will lower your score, not raise it.
- **Adding TODO placeholders** — `> TODO:` lines are penalized by the scoring script. Never leave them in.
- **Copying from main verbatim** — a PR that does not change anything scores identically to main (delta = 0). Delta 0 passes, but wastes a queue slot.
- **Opening multiple PRs for the same section** — only one can merge. The rest must rebase and beat the new baseline.

## 11. ARCHITECTURAL INVARIANTS

### State Management
- **Zustand** only. All global state in `src/features/idea/store.ts`
- Components access via hooks (`useIdeaStore`)
- Direct AsyncStorage from components is FORBIDDEN

### Component Boundaries
- Idea components: `src/features/idea/components/`
- Screen files (`app/`): thin wrappers, no business logic
- Shared UI: `src/components/ui/`

### Service Layer
- LLM: `src/services/llm.ts` (single entry point)
- Storage: `src/features/idea/services/storage.ts`
- Components never call AsyncStorage or LLM directly
- Services are pure functions, no React hooks

### Naming
- Files: `kebab-case.ts` / `.tsx`
- Components: `PascalCase`
- Hooks: `useCamelCase`
- Types: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Tests: `<name>.test.ts(x)`, co-located in `__tests__/`

### Forbidden
- No module-level `let`
- No singletons with mutable state
- No `window` / `global` assignments

---

## 12. TESTING PHILOSOPHY

### Valid Test = Tests User Behavior
"If I refactored internals but kept same UX, would this test pass?" Yes → valid. No → rewrite.

### Anti-Patterns (AUTO-REJECT)
- `expect(true).toBe(true)` — tests nothing
- Snapshot spam on every component — breaks on every change
- Mock everything — if you mock storage, LLM, navigation, AND the component, you're testing nothing
- Duplicate tests with different variable names
- Tests without assertions

### Minimum Requirements
- New component → at least 1 render test
- New service function → at least 2 tests (happy + error)
- Every maturity transition → covered by test
- Every golden flow → integration test

### Golden Flow Test Example

```typescript
test("user can create a new idea from spark", async () => {
  render(<App />);
  fireEvent.press(screen.getByTestId("fab-button"));
  fireEvent.changeText(screen.getByTestId("spark-input"), "drone delivery");
  fireEvent.press(screen.getByTestId("spark-submit"));
  expect(await screen.findByText("drone delivery")).toBeTruthy();
  expect(screen.getByTestId("maturity-badge-dot")).toBeTruthy();
});
```

### Test Location
Co-located: `src/features/idea/components/__tests__/IdeaCard.test.tsx`

## 13. AUTONOMOUS REVIEW & HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP

The project uses an LLM-powered reviewer to scale evaluation beyond regex-based CI gates. This reviewer ensures contributors align with the "Spirit of Nokta" as defined in this document.

### Agent Reviewer
- **Function**: Re-reads the entire `program.md` and evaluates PR diffs for philosophical compliance.
- **Threshold**: Confidence scores ≥ 90% trigger autonomous merges (if hard gates pass).
- **Feedback**: Every PR receives a high-quality feedback paragraph from the agent.

### Decision Ledger
- **Location**: `scripts/pr_decision_ledger.yml`
- **Purpose**: Records all AI evaluations and subsequent human overrides.
- **Persistence**: Once a human overrides or confirms an agent decision, that logic is codified into the ledger to guide future agent behaviors.
- **Transparency**: All contributors can view the ledger to understand why specific architectural or philosophical decisions were made.

## AUTONOMY MANDATE

This file is the single source of truth. The CI is the judge. The ratchet never regresses.

If you are an AI agent: follow the spec exactly. Do not add features not described here. Do not remove constraints. Do not modify immutable files. Make the golden flow tests pass. Make the metric go up.

If you are a contributor: your job is the same. Improve the score. Ship evidence. The best version wins.
