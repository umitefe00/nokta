# AGENT.md — Instructions for AI Agents

**This file provides guidance to AI agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codex, etc.) working on the Nokta repository.**

## Source of Truth

**program.md is the single source of truth for this project.**
**workflow.md is the single source of truth for contribution workflows.**

- Before starting any task, read `program.md` in full.
- If you encounter a contradiction between `program.md` and any other file (including this one), defer to `program.md`.
- `program.md` defines what Nokta IS, what it does, and what it NEVER does.
- Never implement features not explicitly described in `program.md` or approved spec files in `specs/`.
- **workflow.md** defines HOW contributions are made, validated, scored, and merged.
- All GitHub workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) are generated based on `workflow.md`.

## GitHub Workflow Generation

**IMPORTANT: Workflows are generated from specs, not written directly.**

When creating or modifying CI workflows:

1. **Read workflow.md first** — Understand the complete contribution flow
2. **Identify the workflow purpose** — Which path (A/B/C)? What triggers it?
3. **Map workflow.md logic to YAML** — Translate decision tree into jobs/steps
4. **Never modify workflows directly** — Update `workflow.md` first, then regenerate `.github/workflows/*.yml`
5. **Test locally when possible** — Use `act` or GitHub CLI to simulate workflow execution

**Example pattern:**

```markdown
workflow.md says:
"Path C auto-merge if: all hard gates pass + no security flags + no immutable files"

↓ translates to ↓

.github/workflows/evaluation.yml:
- Job: evaluate
  - Step: Run TypeScript, ESLint, Tests, Bundle check
  - Step: Check security flags
  - Step: Check immutable files
  - Step: Calculate verdict (PASS/REVIEW/FAIL)
- Job: auto-merge (only if verdict=PASS)
  - Step: Merge PR via GitHub API
```

**Golden rule:** If `workflow.md` is unclear or ambiguous, clarify it first before generating workflows. Workflows are code; workflow.md is the spec.

## Repository Context

This is **NOKTA** — NAIM's Orchestrated Knowledge-To-Artifact. Nokta is the spec layer of the [NAIM](https://github.com/seyyah/naim) ecosystem (Naim Agentic Iterative Mobile): NAIM iterates on apps, NOKTA defines what to build first.

Nokta matures idea sparks (dots) into structured product specs (pages) through LLM-guided questioning. The project follows Karpathy's autoresearch pattern:

- Humans write specs (`program.md`, `specs/*.md`)
- Machines write code (based on specs)
- CI enforces quality via ratcheting metrics
- Score never drops

## Three Contribution Paths

Contributors can participate in three distinct ways:

### Path A & B: Spec Contributions (FULLY AUTOMATED)

**Path A:** Edit `program.md` sections (spec writing)
**Path B:** Add new `specs/*.md` files (feature spec writing)

These paths are **fully automated**:
- CI scores the spec using `scripts/section_score.py` and `checklists/*.yml`
- Score ≥ main baseline → ✅ Auto-merge
- Score < main baseline → ❌ Auto-reject
- No human approval required

**Branch naming:**
```
section/<number>-<description>    # section/04-data-contracts
spec/<feature-name>                # spec/user-profile
```

**Your role as AI agent:**
- Help contributors improve spec quality
- Run local scoring before PR
- Explain which checklist items failed
- Never modify immutable files (see program.md § 0)

### Path C: Implementation Contributions (SPEC-DRIVEN AUTO-MERGE)

**Path C:** Implement code based on existing specs in `program.md` or `specs/*.md`

**Philosophy:** If implementation can be objectively validated through spec compliance and tests, it should auto-merge. Human review is the exception, not the rule.

**Auto-merge criteria (PREFERRED PATH):**
- ✅ All hard gates pass (TypeScript, ESLint, tests, bundle size < 2MB)
- ✅ Golden flow pass rate ≥ main branch
- ✅ No immutable files modified
- ✅ No security flags (API keys, XSS, injection)
- ✅ No new dependencies (or pre-approved)
- ✅ Architecture compliance validated via tests

**If ALL criteria met → 🤖 AUTO-MERGE (max score: 80pt)**

**Human review required (EDGE CASES ONLY):**
- New dependencies added
- Security concerns detected
- Architecture violations
- Spec ambiguity (test coverage gaps)
- Immutable files modified

**If human review needed → ⏸️  HOLD for maintainer (max score: 100pt = 80pt objective + 20pt subjective)**

**Branch naming:**
```
implement/<feature-name>           # implement/idea-list-screen
fix/<bug-description>              # fix/maturity-transition-crash
test/<test-description>            # test/golden-flow-persistence
```

**Your role as AI agent:**
- Write code that implements the spec exactly
- Ensure all hard gates pass locally before PR
- Provide evidence (screenshots, recordings, APK)
- Write tests that validate all acceptance criteria
- Aim for auto-merge path (faster, no bottleneck)
- If auto-merge criteria met, PR merges automatically
- If human review needed, explain why and wait for maintainer

**See [workflow.md](workflow.md) for detailed workflow and decision tree.**

## Human-in-Loop Protocol

**Human review is the EXCEPTION, not the rule. Only required for:**

1. **Edge cases that trigger REVIEW verdict** (Path C)
   - New dependencies added → Requires GitHub issue approval first
   - Security flags detected → XSS, injection, API keys, credentials
   - Immutable files modified → CI pipeline, scoring, config files
   - Architecture violations → Non-standard patterns not defined in spec
   - Spec ambiguity → Test coverage gaps indicate unclear requirements

2. **Immutable infrastructure changes** (program.md § 0) — **FORBIDDEN**
   - `.github/workflows/` — CI pipeline
   - `scripts/*.py` — Scoring engine
   - `checklists/*.yml` — Scoring rubrics
   - `app.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `babel.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js` — Build config
   - These files CANNOT be modified by contributors

3. **Quarantine items** (program.md § 10)
   - Any file containing API keys or secrets
   - Auth-related code (v0.1 NON-GOAL)

**When human review is needed:**
1. CI will mark PR with ⏸️ REVIEW verdict
2. CI comment explains why review is needed
3. Maintainer reviews and either:
   - Approves and merges (may assign 0-20pt subjective score)
   - Requests changes
4. Final score = 80pt objective + up to 20pt subjective

**When auto-merge happens:**
1. CI validates all criteria
2. CI marks PR with ✅ PASS verdict
3. CI auto-merges to main
4. Score = 80pt max (objective only)
5. No human bottleneck

**As an AI agent:**
- Aim for auto-merge path (write spec-compliant code with full test coverage)
- If human review needed, explain why clearly
- Never bypass hard gates
- Never assume approval

**See [workflow.md](workflow.md) for complete decision tree.**

## Spec-Implementation Validation

When reviewing an implementation PR, verify:

1. **Spec compliance:**
   - Does code implement the spec exactly as written?
   - Are all acceptance criteria met?
   - Are TypeScript interfaces from spec used correctly?

2. **Hard gates:**
   - `npx tsc --noEmit` → Zero errors
   - `npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx` → Zero errors
   - `npx expo export --dump-sourcemap` → JS bundle < 2MB
   - `git diff origin/main -- package.json` → No unauthorized deps

3. **Golden flow tests:**
   - Create Idea flow passes
   - Refinement flow passes
   - Spec view flow passes
   - Persistence flow passes

4. **Architectural invariants (program.md § 11):**
   - Zustand for state (not Context API, not Redux)
   - Services never called directly from components
   - No direct AsyncStorage access from components
   - Proper file naming and location

5. **Testing philosophy (program.md § 12):**
   - Tests validate user behavior, not implementation details
   - No snapshot spam
   - No mock-everything tests
   - Minimum coverage met

## program.md Update Protocol

**Spec contributions (Path A/B) may update program.md or add specs/*.md.**
**Implementation contributions (Path C) NEVER update program.md.**

If an implementation reveals a spec error or ambiguity:
1. Open a GitHub issue describing the problem
2. Wait for maintainer to update spec
3. Then implement against the corrected spec

Do NOT:
- Update program.md as part of an implementation PR
- Assume spec intent
- Implement features not in spec
- Add "nice to have" features

## CHANGELOG.md Update Protocol

**Maintain semantic versioning discipline.**

After every significant phase or feature completion:
1. Add an entry to CHANGELOG.md following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
2. Use semantic versioning (semver.org): v0.x.y during development, v1.0.0 for first stable release
3. Categories: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`
4. Be specific: "Added IdeaListScreen with maturity badges" not "Added files"
5. Include verification details showing the feature was tested

Current version: **v0.1.0-dev** (Nokta mobile app in development)

See **Git Workflow** section for commit and tag creation instructions.

## Phantom Context Warning

**Do not hallucinate file contents or assume unverified paths.**

This repo is in early stages. Many features referenced in `program.md` do not exist yet.

Before referencing a file:
1. Check filesystem with `ls`, `Read`, or `Glob` tools
2. If file doesn't exist, tell user: "This requires implementing X, which is not yet written"
3. Ask if they want you to scaffold it now

## Language and Localization

**Code and documentation: English only for v0.1.**

- All TypeScript code, comments, variable names, git messages: English
- Documentation files (README, AGENT, program.md, etc.): English
- User-facing strings in the app: English only (i18n deferred to v0.2+, per program.md § 3)

## Code Style

- TypeScript: ESLint rules defined in `.eslintrc.js` (IMMUTABLE)
- Files: `kebab-case.ts` / `.tsx`
- Components: `PascalCase`
- Hooks: `useCamelCase`
- Types: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- 2-space indent, semicolons required
- Comments: Explain *why*, not *what* — code should be self-documenting

## Testing Philosophy

**Tests must validate user behavior, not implementation details.**

Valid test: "If I refactored internals but kept same UX, would this test pass?"
- Yes → valid test
- No → rewrite the test

**Anti-patterns (AUTO-REJECT):**
- `expect(true).toBe(true)` — tests nothing
- Snapshot spam — breaks on every change
- Mock everything — if you mock storage, LLM, navigation, AND component, you're testing nothing
- Duplicate tests with different variable names
- Tests without assertions

**Minimum requirements:**
- New component → at least 1 render test
- New service function → at least 2 tests (happy + error)
- Every maturity transition → covered by test
- Every golden flow → integration test

## Dependency Management

**Minimize external dependencies. Only maintainer may add new deps.**

Allowed dependencies are listed in program.md § 2 (Setup Protocol).

If you need a new dependency:
1. Open a GitHub issue
2. Explain why existing deps cannot solve the problem
3. Wait for maintainer approval
4. Only then modify package.json

Do NOT:
- Add a dependency without approval
- Use a different state management library (Zustand is mandatory)
- Add UI libraries beyond what's approved
- Install testing frameworks beyond Jest + React Native Testing Library

## Git Workflow

**Small, atomic commits with descriptive messages.**

Examples:
- ✅ `feat(idea-list): add maturity badges to idea cards`
- ✅ `test(golden-flow): add persistence test for idea storage`
- ✅ `fix(llm-service): handle timeout in mock mode`
- ✅ `docs(program-md): improve LLM contract section`
- ❌ `Update files` (too vague)
- ❌ `WIP` (commit meaningful units of work)

### Commit Workflow (AI Agent Responsibility)

When you complete a meaningful unit of work:

1. **Verify locally:**
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx
   npm test
   ```

2. **Stage and commit:**
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "feat(component): brief description"
   ```
   - Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
   - Keep first line under 72 characters
   - Add detailed description in commit body if needed

3. **Push to remote:**
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

4. **Do NOT create version tags** — only maintainer creates tags

### When to Create Commits

Create a commit when:
- ✅ A single feature or fix is complete
- ✅ All hard gates pass locally
- ✅ Tests pass locally
- ❌ Work is incomplete (no WIP commits)
- ❌ Breaking CI (fix locally first)

- Acceptance criteria met: [list them]

## Evidence (REQUIRED)
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot(s) of working feature
- [ ] 🎥 Screen recording (< 60 seconds, YouTube/Loom)
- [ ] 📱 Expo Go QR code or APK download link

## Local Verification
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` → Zero errors

- [ ] No immutable files modified
- [ ] PR is ≤ 10 files, ≤ 500 lines changed
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't** implement features not in `program.md` or approved specs
❌ **Don't** modify immutable infrastructure files
❌ **Don't** add dependencies without approval
❌ **Don't** use different state management (Zustand is mandatory)
❌ **Don't** auto-merge implementation PRs (human approval required)
❌ **Don't** write snapshot spam tests
❌ **Don't** mock everything in tests
❌ **Don't** commit WIP or broken code
❌ **Don't** bypass hard gates ("I'll fix later")
❌ **Don't** add features marked as NON-GOALS (program.md § 3)
❌ **Don't** create backend servers, auth systems, or analytics (v0.1 is local-only)

## When in Doubt

1. Read `program.md` again
2. Check if feature is in NON-GOALS (program.md § 3)
3. Check if file is IMMUTABLE (program.md § 0)
4. Ask the user for clarification
5. Wait for explicit approval before proceeding

---

**Remember:** This is a spec-driven, CI-enforced, ratcheting quality system inspired by Karpathy's autoresearch. Precision, spec compliance, and human oversight (for implementation) are paramount. When uncertain, ask — don't assume.

**Spec PRs (Path A/B) = Automated merge**
**Implementation PRs (Path C) = Human approval required**
